## Making a Request

To make a WCOSS2 installation request, create an issue.

## The Request Process

Before any WCOSS2 install, the software must be installed and tested on R&D machine(s).

Once an issue is created, the following steps will be followed:

1. Software will be installed on acorn for testing by requester.
2. Requester tests software on acorn, and updates issue with results.
3. The software is installed in test directory on WCOSS2. Issue is updated.
4. Requester tests software on WCOSS2, and updates issue with results.
5. Installation Request/Instructions are written by reponsible developers.
6. Installation Request/Instructions are submitted to repo as PR, must be approved by Responsible Developers, and requester.
7. Instructions are merged to repo and delivered to NCO.
